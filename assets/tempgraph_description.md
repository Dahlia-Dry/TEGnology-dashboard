This graph shows a real-time feed of data from a [Watteco Press'O](https://www.watteco.com/product/presso-sensor-lorawan/) LoRaWAN class A sensor/tranceiver powered by our [Sensever Alfa](https://www.tegnology.dk/sensever-alfa/). The Alfa is mounted outside our office building and is converting the temperature difference between the building surface and the surrounding air into a steady 3.3V power supply. This temperature difference can be observed on the graph as the gap between the red trace tracking the surface temperature and the blue trace tracking the air temperature. The Watteco temperature sensor transmits data continuously via a nearby connected LoRaWAN gateway to the IoT platform [tago.io](tago.io), which we then query periodically using the associated API to display in this [python-powered dashboard](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/TEGnology-dashboard).
