This graph shows a real-time feed of data from a [Watteco Remote Temperature 2](http://support.nke-watteco.com/remote-temperature-2/) LoRaWAN class A sensor powered by our [Sensever Alfa TEG](https://www.tegnology.dk/sensever-alfa/). The Alfa is mounted atop a hot pipe and replaces a conventional battery by converting the heat energy into a steady 3.3V power supply. The Watteco temperature sensor transmits data continuously via a nearby connected LoRaWAN gateway to the IoT platform [tago.io](tago.io), which we then query periodically using the associated API to display in this [python-powered dashboard](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/TEGnology-dashboard).
